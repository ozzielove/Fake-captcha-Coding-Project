# Fake-captcha-Coding-Project
Lab-only blue-team demo of an HTML-smuggling fake CAPTCHA that copies benign PowerShell one-liners to the clipboard, with MDE/Sentinel detections, MCP least-privilege, guardrails, Sysmon clipboard config, YARA, CI, and step-by-step docs. Benign by design.

This repository delivers a self-contained, lab-only training project that simulates a social flow (fake CAPTCHA -> clipboard -> PowerShell) using benign payloads (e.g., Notepad/Calc). It ships a hardened HTML page with strict CSP/Permissions-Policy, rotating safe PowerShell seeds, and an evaluation harness gated by LAB_EXECUTE (default ON). Detection content targets Microsoft Defender for Endpoint + Microsoft Sentinel (KQL-first) for rare parent of PowerShell, EncodedCommand, and MTTA. A minimal MCP-style server enforces least-privilege via policy.json (out-of-scope -> 403 DENY + alert). Deterministic guardrails block OS-command instructions in LLM outputs, with unit tests. The repo also includes Sysmon clipboard lab config, YARA indicators, EDR policy samples, GitHub Actions CI (optional pysigma), and thorough README/TUTORIAL guidance. LAB ONLY: no malware, no exfiltration, no persistence, no privilege escalation.
